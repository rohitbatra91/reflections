How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It's interesting to see how the differences can be comparedwithin command prompt using FC
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It would make it easier to massively collaborate online, see what people changed.
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Manually commiting is better for choosing the just right commit size. Docs would make too many small saves or too large. 
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because docs are usually separate entirely, e.g. a book or some document whereas code can be together.
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log to see a log of all the files and git diff with two different commit ids to compare the differences between those 2 commits.
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
I can restore to any previous commit which had working code. 
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I want to use Git for when I start programming my android apps.
